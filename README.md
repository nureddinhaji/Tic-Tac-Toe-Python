# Tic Tac Toe with Python

The classic Tic Tac Toe Game (XO Game) is based on Python using GUI Tkinter to make the interface of the game.

I developed it as a project in [The Front End Diploma at the Almdrasa platform](https://almdrasa.com/front-end-diploma/).

## Features
Our Tic Tac Toe game features a user-friendly interface with attractive colors, created using the tkinter GUI library. Before starting the game, you can choose from the following options:

* Who will play first (you or the computer)?
* The computer's intelligence level (low or high).

If you select the low intelligence level, the computer will choose random fields to fill. However, if you select the high intelligence level, the computer will make strategic choices based on an analysis of the current game state and your moves.

We developed our own computer intelligence algorithms using conditional statements.

You can also view both your score and the computer's score.

## Usage

### With .py file
You can use our Tic Tac Toe Python script (.py file) to play the game by running it in a Python interpreter. Additionally, you can use it as a reference to create your own Tic Tac Toe game (XO Game) in Python.

### With .exe file
Alternatively, you can try our executable file (.exe) to run the game directly without the need to use a Python interpreter.

### There is no need to install any additional modules:

In our Python-based Tic Tac Toe game, we did not use any third-party modules. We only utilized the tkinter and random modules, both of which are included with Python by default.
